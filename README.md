Hypothesis Testing Across Real-World Scenarios
•	Stone Hardness Analysis for Zingaro: Analyzed polished and unpolished stones using hypothesis testing to validate concerns about unpolished stones’ suitability for printing and compared mean hardness between both categories.
•	Aquarius Health Club Program Success: Conducted a paired t-test to assess the effectiveness of a rigorous body-conditioning program, ensuring statistical significance of push-up improvements.
•	Dental Implant Hardness Analysis: Explored differences in implant hardness based on dentists and methods using ANOVA, separately for two alloys. Identified specific pairs of dentists and methods with significant differences.
